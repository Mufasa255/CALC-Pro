# Pro Calc

**Pro Calc** is a basic calculator web application designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with future plans to extend its functionality to support more advanced operations, making it a fully functional scientific calculator.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Decimal Calculations**: Handles numbers with decimal points.
- **Keyboard Support**: Allows users to enter numbers and operations via the keyboard.
- **Real-Time Evaluation**: Evaluates expressions dynamically and provides results instantly.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message for invalid expressions (e.g., starting or ending with an operator, division by zero).

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for future versions include:
- Support for advanced operations like trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponents, and roots.
- Additional calculator modes (e.g., scientific, programmer).
- Improved UI and responsive design for better user experience on different devices.
